## moB: an open platform for everyday mobility

**moB (short for "Mon Compte Mobilité")** was an open-source digital platform backed by public actors in France, designed to make mobility services and incentives more accessible to citizens. It aimed to simplify access to benefits offered by local authorities, employers, and the national government by integrating them into a user-centric, ecological, and interoperable digital system.

> Since its launch in 2020, moB evolved significantly, reaching a new level of maturity between late 2021 and 2024.

## A structuring project between public and private stakeholders

The moB project began as part of the national energy savings program CEE "Mon Compte Mobilité" (2019–2023), co-led by ADEME, Capgemini, and the Fabrique des Mobilités. From April 2023 onward, FabMob officially took over operational management through a structured partnership with ADEME.

Between 2023 and 2024, the project entered a new phase marked by:

* **continued operational support**, with hosting transitioned from Capgemini to Flowbird;
* **development of new use cases** (e.g., third-party payment, unified ZFE application, identity federation, accessibility);
* **expansion of the partner ecosystem**, including local authorities, carpooling providers, and employers;
* **implementation of open governance** among all stakeholders involved.

Due to the absence of sustainable funding beyond 2024 from key public actors (ADEME, DGITM), and following the end of the national carpooling incentive scheme that moB helped implement, it was collectively decided to shut down the platform in January 2025.

## My role in the moB Project

I contributed to moB in various capacities over time:

### 2021 — Mobility and standards expert

At this stage, I worked as a technical and strategic advisor for the Fabrique des Mobilités, focusing on data interoperability, operator engagement, and coordination with the national CEE program's standardization efforts.

### 2022–2024 — Project director

As **project director**, I was responsible for:

* overall coordination and reporting to ADEME and DGEC;
* operational management (timeline, budget, team coordination, technical decisions);
* reshaping the technical partnership with **Flowbird** as the new hosting and operating partner;
* managing relationships with funders (ADEME, DGITM) and embedded service operators.

### 2023–2024 — Product Owner and Functional Design

As **product owner**, I defined the roadmap, facilitated workshops with users, partners, and developers, and ensured alignment between territorial needs and technical development. I contributed to:

* implementation of **mobility third-party payment** (e.g., in La Rochelle);
* design of a **ZFE unified application desk** (ultimately not launched);
* collaboration with **EONA-X** on accessibility in multimodal travel.

### Late 2024 — Project Closure and Outlook

I coordinated the **end of the ADEME program** and the platform's closure six months later, after DGITM, the original institutional sponsor, decided not to pursue the project further despite earlier functional and strategic investigations.

### Key people who made this possible

Nothing would have been achieved without them:

* [Julie Braka](https://www.linkedin.com/in/juliebraka/) managed the (often Kafkaesque) administration of a CEE program with Capgemini as funding partner—including state-level processes and tools. She also led communication, documentation, events, webinars, and more.
* [Charles Waubant](https://www.linkedin.com/in/charleswaubant/), a determined and dedicated project manager (2023–2024). Most achievements can be traced back to his drive.
* [Alex Bourreau](https://github.com/TTalex) did more than oversee development: he documented the codebase, maintained the GitHub, set up open-source frameworks, onboarded new contributors, managed the transition to Flowbird, built POCs, debugged and supported users, and wrapped up the final report. Outstanding work.
* [Frédéric Laithier](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric-laithier-155b9a57/) and [Vincent Bouressam](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vincent-bouressam-38989a106/) at Flowbird achieved remarkable things in 2023 and 2024, sometimes with limited resources. Their user-centric vision of digital mobility services remains rare and valuable.
* Before my full involvement, a dedicated team at Capgemini helped build, open-source, and transition the platform. Thank you.
